What is the Smalltalk expression for the square root of 2?
sqrt (2)
2 sqrt
Number::sqrt 2

What is ((lambda (x) x) (+ 2 3) ?
(+ 2 3)
+
10
5
d
In a garbage collected language like Java, with no free function or its equivalent, \nif M = memory leaks and D = dangling pointers or references, which is possible?
D but not M
M but not D
Both M and D
Neither M nor D
b
What is the running time of let rec f n = if n <= 1 then n else f (n-1) + f (n-2) ?
O(log2 n)
O(n)
O(2^n)
O(n^2)
c
The Java idea of an interface is implemented in Smalltalk as:
abstract classes
duck typing
multiple inheritance of fields
single inheritance
b
For a list of length n, how much function call stack space is used by fold left and fold right?
fold left O(1) and fold right O(1)
fold left O(1) and fold right O(n)
fold left O(n) and fold right O(1)
fold left O(n) and fold right O(n)
b
In Smalltalk what is the meaning of: foo bar + foo set: 3 + 4 next
((foo bar) + foo) set: (3 + (4 next))
(foo (bar + foo)) set: ((3 + 4) next)
(foo bar) + (foo set: 3) + (4 next)
(foo bar) + (foo set: 3) + (4 next)

What is 7 in Smalltalk?
(+) 3 4.
(3+4) value.
[3+4] value.
{3+4} value.
c
Which function can be implemented using a constant amount of stack space?
filter
fold_left
fold_right
map
b
The PL/1 language allows a non-local goto directly from a function to a label \nin a function deeper down in the function call stack, thus returning past several levels of function calls. \nIn Java, something similar can be accomplished by what statement?
goto
implements
synchronized
throw

sum 3 value 4 value
sum value: 3 value: 4
d
